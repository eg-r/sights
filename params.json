  "body": "### Description\r\nSIGHTS is a suite of normalization methods, statistical tests, and diagnostic graphical tools for high throughput screening (HTS) assays.   \r\nHTS assays use microtitre plates to screen large libraries of compounds for their biological, chemical, or biochemical activity.\r\n\r\n### Usage\r\nSIGHTS is available as a [Bioconductor R-package](http://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/sights.html). Import your HTS data, run diagnostics, try out normalization methods, plot, test and get your results. \r\n\r\n### Support\r\nCheck out our [documentation](http://bioconductor.org/packages/devel/bioc/vignettes/sights/inst/doc/sights.html). Or open a [GitHub issue](https://github.com/eg-r/sights/issues).\r\n\r\n### Authors & Correspondence\r\nElika Garg (@eg-r), Carl Murie, Robert Nadon   \r\n_Contributor:  Heydar Ensha (@heyensha)_  \r\n[Contact package maintainer](mailto:elika.garg@mail.mcgill.ca)\r\n\r\n### Publication\r\n[Murie et al.
